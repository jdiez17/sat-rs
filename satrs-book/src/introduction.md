# Introduction

This is the repository of the sat-rs framework. Its primary goal is to provide re-usable components
to write on-board software for remote systems like rovers or satellites. It is specifically written
for the special requirements for these systems.

A lot of the architecture and general design considerations are based on the
[FSFW](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw) C++ framework which has flight heritage
through the 2 missions [FLP](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/flying-laptop/)
and [EIVE](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/EIVE/).
